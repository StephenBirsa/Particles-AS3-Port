# Particles-AS3-Port
Particles JS tutorial ported to actionscript 3.0 and Adobe Air in FlashDevelop (2015) 

Closer to the end 2015, I followed this tutorial again http://www.playfuljs.com/particle-effects-are-easy/
and ported the javascript to actionscript 3.0 as best as I could with my knowledge at the time.

The end result was much better than my AS2 port, as the program worked very similar to the demo that the JS author posted.
